## BASIC DETAILS
### TEAM NAME: Greyscale

### Team Members:
- Team Lead: [Sabari Vijayan]     - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam
- Member 2: [Haridev M]           - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam
- Member 3: [Anna Grace Abraham]  - Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam

 
 ### Project Description
- This project aims to create a fine-tuned language model specialized in the KTU (Kerala Technological University) syllabus. The goal is to develop a resource that can answer questions, summarize content, and provide insights based on the KTU curriculum, making study and revision easier for students. By fine-tuning a language model on KTU-specific content such as textbooks, syllabus documents, and past question papers, we can create a powerful tool for academic assistance.

## Academic Resource Collection

This project collects and structures academic resources such as KTU textbooks, syllabus documentation, and past question papers.

## The Solution

Using a specialized language model, this tool enables easy study and revision of KTU topics, offering summaries, explanations, and question-answering functionalities tailored to the KTU curriculum.

 ## Team Contributions

Our project was brought to life through the dedicated efforts and expertise of each team member, contributing uniquely to the creation of a robust and effective academic tool.

- **[Sabari]**: Fine-tuned the large language model (LLM), optimizing it for accuracy and relevance to the KTU syllabus, ensuring that the model is both responsive and informative for students.

- **[Haridev]**: Developed the server and application infrastructure, seamlessly integrating it with the LLM model to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for interaction.

- **[Anna]**: Curated and prepared the dataset for training, also contributing to the fine-tuning process of the LLM, which was critical to the model's ability to offer tailored responses aligned with the KTU curriculum.
